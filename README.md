# Workshop: Learning C# on Linux

This repository contains the content for a workshop I am putting together
on Learning C# on Linux using .NET Core.  This is a work in progress 
so feel free to contribute but I'll probably make some major
changes here before porting the content over to somewhere official like
the [.NET Core Docs](https://github.com/dotnet/core-docs).

## Learning C# on Linux
C# is a modern, advanced general purpose programming language and is now fully open source and supported on Linux.
In this short workshop you will learn how to be productive with the new modern C# on Linux,
what it is like building high performance web workloads in ASP.NET and what tooling support you have available.

**Target Audience:** This workshop is aimed at developers with no prior knowledge of C#
but have experience with other programming languages.

## Workshop Contents

 1. [Getting Started](001-Getting-Started/) - Installing pre-requisites and getting .NET Core installed on your system
 2. [Hello C# World](002-Hello-CSharp/) - Learn the structure of a basic C# program
 3. [C# Language Basics](003-Language-Basics/) - Learn the basics of the C# language such as variables, expressions
    control flow, loops, control flow, generics and more.
 4. [Properties](004-Properties) - Defining properties in C# classes
 
More to follow...

## Additional Reading
For more information and additional tutorials related to learning C# on Linux see the following. Note that the
.NET team are currently moving from several command line tools (such as `dnx`) to the `dotnet` command
therefore some of the tutorials may be a little out of date at the time of writing.
